      I currently work with the US Government as a bespoke technology contractor to help various organizations to achieve their goals.
      Previously, I studied EECS at UC Berkeley, where I co-founded and served as Vice President of <a href="https://rab.berkeley.edu/">Robotics at Berkeley</a>, served as <a href="https://octo.asuc.org/">CTO of the ASUC</a>, Berkeley's student government, 
      and researched at both <a href="https://bovelab.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Bove Lab</a> and the <a href="https://rael.berkeley.edu/">Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory</a>. 
      I am proud of my work and am grateful for the mentorship and collaboration I get with the folks I work with. As such, I am not currently looking for job opportunities at this time.
      <br><br> 

      Here are some things that get me excited as a technologist:
      <li>
        <ul>
          <b>Intelligence:</b> In the modern era, one of the greatest threats internally and domestically is foreign intelligence meddling in our affairs.
          In the 1980s, Chinese Military Strategist Qiao Liang outline a plan to destroy the United States in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unrestricted-Warfare-Chinas-Destroy-America/dp/1626543054">Unrestricted Warfare</a>.
          Strategies proposed included <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf">reducing confidence in the US Election System</a>,
          <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/19/china-buying-us-farms-foreign-purchase-499893">inflicting harm on the US economic system</a>, 
          and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/china-another-hack-us-cybersecurity-issues-mount-rcna744">attacking and crippling network infrastructure</a>. While China may not be at the helm of engaging
          in these strategies, it is clear that the US Intelligence Community must protect against such threats.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Critical Infrastructure:</b> One of the largest threats to US National Security is the vulnerability of US infrastructure to attacks.
          A recent example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack">Colonial Pipeline Attack</a>.
          One of my work collaborators, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO25/20180307/106956/HHRG-115-GO25-Bio-EverettPhDJ-20180307.pdf">Dr. John Everett</a>,
          spearheaded several DARPA initiatives to create fault recovery methods and vulnerability isolation in the US Grid. Some of his work has been adopted by utility providers.
          Ultimately, this is a policy problem. Two great books to learn about both physical and cyber vulnerabilities are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grid-Fraying-Between-Americans-Energy-ebook/dp/B01DM9Q6CQ">The Grid</a>
          and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lights-Out-Cyberattack-Unprepared-Surviving-ebook/dp/B00UQERM4C/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1663516734&sr=8-13">Lights Out</a>. 
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Climate Change:</b> This is the largest existential risk to humanity, in my opinion. Elsewhere in the world, there is a clear recognition from national governments that climate Change
          will be catastrophic (for example, the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/the-maldives-is-being-swallowed-by-the-sea-can-it-adapt">Maldives may go underwater</a> if current trends continue). Unfortunately, here in the United States, there is no such collective public sector recognition
          of this problem. Thus, it is likely on the shoulders of the private sector to help to fix this problem for now. The obvious first start to this is electric vehicles. Two cool companies that
          I think will help to bring EVs to the masses are <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a> and <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1137100_commercial-ev-startup-harbinger-no-cost-premium-vs-gas-or-diesel">Harbinger</a>. 
          The longer-term fix would be improved public transportation in US cities, but that unfortunately is probably off the table in the medium-term. The next step would be to de-carbonize the grid.
          This is challenging due to the nature of local utility monopolies. One cool company that is attempting to improve things in this area is <a href="https://www.cleanpower.com/">Clean Power Research</a>.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Supply Chains:</b> The United States was once at the forefront of global manufacturing. The de-industrialization of America has both caused the loss of middle-class jobs
          as well as a collective loss of knowledge into how many of our manufacturing processes work. I personally have worked with several contract manufacturers in my projects, and I have noticed
          that many have been working since the 60s and 70s during the space race. This means that many are retiring from the industry. If the US wishes to innovate in the aerospace, clean technology,
          and other sectors, it must re-learn from its past and re-invigorate its supply chain, particularly with respect to manufacturing. Two interesting companies doing just that in this space are <a href="https://www.desktopmetal.com/">Desktop Metal</a>
          and <a href="https://www.hadrian.co/">Hadrian</a>. I am excited to see what both do!
        </ul>
      </li>

      <br>
      In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, tinkering, running, hiking, cooking, learning new languages, volunteering in my community, and attempting to do Jiu Jitsu.
      Please feel to reach out to me if you would like to grab coffee and chat!
