      I am currently a Founding Engineer at <a href="https://www.kaizenlabs.co/">Kaizen Labs</a>.
      Previously, I studied EECS at UC Berkeley, where I co-founded and served as Vice President of <a href="https://rab.berkeley.edu/">Robotics at Berkeley</a>, served as <a href="https://octo.asuc.org/">CTO of the ASUC</a>, Berkeley's student government, 
      and researched at both <a href="https://bovelab.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Bove Lab</a> and the <a href="https://rael.berkeley.edu/">Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory</a>. I absolutely love working with my friends in this space; therefore, I am not
      looking at new job opportunities at this time.
      <br><br> 

      In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, running, hiking, skiing, practicing guitar, cooking new recipes, and practicing my Spanish.
      Please feel to reach out to me if you would like to grab coffee and chat!
